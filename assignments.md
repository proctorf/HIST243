# Assignment Possibilities

## Overarching statement

This course asks you to build clear, evidence-based historical arguments about sexuality in Latin America by treating sexuality as a social and historical construct shaped by power, law, religion, labor, race, and gender. Across 3–5 readings per unit (with room to incorporate additional sources), you will develop a defendable thesis, synthesize multiple perspectives, and situate local cases within broader historiographical contexts. You may choose from a range of innovative, nontraditional formats or write the standard six-page interpretive essay as the baseline; in all cases, your work should demonstrate deep critical thinking, careful source use, and coherent argumentation. If you select a nontraditional format, you must include a brief reflection explaining how the format influenced your argument and use of sources.

### Quick expectations checklist
- Clear historical argument and thesis
  - Each unit deliverable must present a defendable claim about sexuality as a social/historical construct.
  - Ground your argument in multiple readings (3–5) and, when allowed, additional sources you cite properly.

- Engagement with readings
  - Demonstrate close reading, cite and quote/paraphrase from multiple readings, and address historiographical debates.
  - Show how different sources illuminate context, power relations, and everyday practices related to sexuality.

- Synthesis across sources
  - Move beyond summary to synthesize across readings, identifying agreements, tensions, and implications for your argument.

- Source use and evidence
  - Use precise evidence (quotations or close paraphrase) and contextualize it within the historical moment.
  - Include citations in the chosen style (Chicago or MLA) and provide a complete bibliography.

- Format and innovation
  - You may choose from the eight nontraditional formats (mini-exhibit, map, zine, website page, museum exhibit, visual timeline, podcast/soundscape, etc.) or the standard six-page essay.
  - Even in nontraditional formats, the argument must be clear and historically grounded.

- Reflection for nontraditional formats
  - Attach a brief reflection explaining how the format influenced argumentation, source selection, and presentation.

- Reflection: Optional (if skipping a traditional essay, add a 1-page reflection on how curatorial choices influenced your argument).

### 7) Visual timeline
- What it is: A 1–2 page narrative timeline (or digital timeline) marking key moments where sexuality intersects with state, society, or reform, using 3–5 readings as anchors.
